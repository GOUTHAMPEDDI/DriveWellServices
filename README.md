This project is a software implementation for a car service station using Object-Oriented Programming in Java.
The software provides various types of services for different types of cars and also generates a detailed bill based on the type of car serviced.

## Tech Used
* Java 

## Features:
- The car service station caters to different types of cars: Hatchback, Sedan, SUV.
- It provides different types of services: Basic Service, Engine Fixing, Clutch Fixing, Gear Fixing, and Brake Fixing.
- Each service has a service code associated with it and different prices for different types of cars.
- The software generates a detailed bill with the total amount for each service request based on the type of car specified and the requested service codes.
- If the total service bill is more than ‚Çπ 10000, a complimentary cleaning is provided and specified in the bill.

## Usage
* When the program starts, it will display a welcome message and provide two options: selecting a car or exiting the program.

* Choose option 1 to select a car for servicing.

* Select the type of car you want to service by entering the corresponding number.

* Once the car type is selected, you will be prompted to choose from a list of service codes.

* Enter the number corresponding to the desired service code to add it to your service list.

* Repeat steps 4 and 5 to add more services or choose option 6 to generate the bill.

* The bill will be displayed, showing the details of the selected services and the total bill amount.
